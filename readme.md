# Malaria Dataset

Creating Data Visualizations with Malaria dataset for SGH Data Analyst Application

## Task

Create 3 informative visualizations about malaria using Python in a Jupyter notebook, starting with the data sets at https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018/2018-11-13.  Your solution should include the following;

o	Convert data to a tidy format
o	Export to normalized tables in an SQLite3 database
o	Use SQL statements (using from within pandas is acceptable) to retrieve the data needed for each visualization 

Place your notebook with reproducible results in a GitHub repository. By reproducible, we mean that when we run all cells in the notebooks, the same visualizations should be recreated each time.

We are looking for evidence of the following basic data science skills:
o	Idiomatic Python
o	Jupyter notebooks
o	Literate programming
o	Experience with version control
o	Data processing skills
o	Relational database knowledge
o	Data visualization skill
